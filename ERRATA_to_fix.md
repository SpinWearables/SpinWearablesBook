Page 11, `refracting` and `cone cells`, inconsistent quote marks.

Page 12, prism image lacks credit.

Page 13, `diregarded` should be `disregarded`.

Page 19, in the code, the `delay` call will mess up the low-pass filter acting upon the measurements. The `readIMU` function is not meant to be used this way, causing significant mangling of the measurement data.

Page 20, `rotation in each dimension` should say `rotation around the x axis`.

Page 20, `do not worry if this does not mean anything to you yet` is left hanging in the air, without an explanation for why it is ok to not understand.

Page 22, `loop` is repeatedly left unformatted, not using monospace font.

Page 24, code block, inconsistent capitalization and punctuation in comments.

Page 24, `delay` is repeatedly left unformatted, not using monospace font.

Page 25, `restarts the code ... and starting ...`, inconsistent verb tenses.

Page 37, figure caption, `below` is misleading.

Page 39, functions that have "angle" arguments do not clearly explain that the units of measurements go from 0 to 255 instead of 0 to 359.

Page 41, `ostandard` should be `standard`.
