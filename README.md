# The SpinWheel Fieldguide Booklet

Made with Scribus version 1.5.5.

## Style guide and Scribus tips

Use the templated *story editor* for the majority of the text. It permits per-paragraph styling. Be careful with the use of the new-line/enter button (alt+enter can be used in the story editor to force new lines that do not force a new styled paragraph).

### Text

How do text frames do pagination? How do text frames interact with images?

### Math

The booklet contains very little math notation. For inline formulas we will use bolded unicode rendition when possible. When not, custom *render frames* can be used.

### Code

Inline code is boring monospaced as in the web page. Code panes might require custom *render frames* with extra LaTeX packages.

### Images

We need a style prescription for them. We also need to decide how they float/break the text.
